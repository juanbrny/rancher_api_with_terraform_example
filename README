This is an example of how to interact with Rancher's API within Terraform.

The Terraform code will connect to an existing Rancher cluster and will use Rancher's API calls to configure an auth provider.

The first step is to get an access key and secret key to connect to the API. For that we'll use the rancher2_token provider.

Once the token is created we can proceed and make authenticated API calls using the local_exec provisioner to launch a curl command.
